# Singleton Practice

Singletons implemented: Game Manager, Slime Player 1, Slime Player 2, and Health Bar 

(Health Bar does not need to be an instance, unless I want health to go back to "100" when going to next scene)

Ways to lose health: Slimes hit each other or red capsules

Ways to gain health: Health circle

Next scene: Collect all the green boxes.
