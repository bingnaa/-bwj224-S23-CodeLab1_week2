# Singleton Practice

Singletons implemented: Game Manager, Slime Player 1, Slime Player 2, and Health Bar 

(Health Bar does not need to be an instance; unless I want health to go back to "100" when going to next scene. In this version of code, the health int is controlled by the Game Manager rather then the Health Bar instance)

Ways to lose health: Slimes hit each other or red capsules

Ways to gain health: Heal circle

Next scene: Collect all the green boxes.
